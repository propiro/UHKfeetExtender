# UHKfeetExtender
Small print for extreme elevation of your UHK keyboard
print vertically, ideally with supports to get nicely printed horisontal gap.
They are very tight fit, so depending on your printer you might want to play with scale, adjusting 1-2% on all axes uniformly - they printed ideally on my STL printer, while for FDM i had to set scale to 102% - just test on base, and if it fit back leg with tight fit, go with rest of the prints on same scale as tested base.

It should look like that after printing:

For added experience, you can buy furniture anti-scratching stickers and cut few of them to fit the feet.

Sadly, I've lost cad file for the print, so geometry is baked - if you want to make some changes, you can re-model it according to my measurements quickly.
